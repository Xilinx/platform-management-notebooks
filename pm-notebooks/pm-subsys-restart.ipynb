    "This demonstrates \"subsystem restart\" feature of platform management framework,\n",
    "which allows restarting a user-defined subsystem without affecting any other subsystem.\n",

    "which includes Arm Cortex-A72 (APU) and Cortex-R5F (RPU) processors.\n",
    "Since this demo restarts the default subsystem which includes APU and RPU,\n",
    "in effect linux running on APU will be restarted.\n",
    "As a result, jupyter notebook server process will be killed,\n",

    "Versal supports various types of reset - from the simplest system reset to the much more complicated subsystem restart.\n",
    "\n",
    "In any system or subsystem which has a processor component and a programmable logic component, reset must entail both reset to the hardware as well as software.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reset to the hardware includes resetting of the processor, all peripherals associated with the system/subsystem,\n",
    "cleaning up of the memory as needed, and making sure that the interconnect is in a clean state, capable of routing traffic.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reset to the software results in the processor starting from the reset vector.\n",
    "However, designer must make sure that valid and clean code for system/subsystem is located at the reset vector in order to bring the system back to a clean running state.\n",
    "\n",
    "The intent of the \"subsystem restart\" feature is to demonstrate how a design with multiple subsystems can cleanly and reliably restart a subsystem without affecting other subsystems in the design. \n",
    "A subsystem is defined as combination of one or more Master and Slave components that work together to accomplish a function. \n",
    "A subsystem can be all the components of a particular operating system, including both PS and PL, but it could also be a function without an operating system, such as PL or ME."
